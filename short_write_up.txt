We are trying to support point reinsertion and branch reinsertion in this branch in order to guarantee min_branch_factor after downsplit. 
We later realize that branch reinsertion requires a more efficient way to clip polygons recursively, therefore we support only point reinsertion here.
Although point reinsertion can guarantee min_branch_factor, eliminates all nodes with small fanouts, and generates a smaller tree, it doesn't provide boost to range search performance.
We think the reason is that doing point reinsertion after split doesn't generate good data layout which results into poorer range performance. 
Therefore, we abandon the idea of using point reinsertion to eliminate node with small fanouts after downsplit. 

Another idea is that we can try reinsertion before split like R*tree
